## Overview 🔍
This project will track the capacity of Yishun Activesg gym over a few days to see which day and time is it least packed. This will allow us to see when is the best time to go there for a workout.

I plan to base how crowded the gym is based on these variables:
- Day 📅 (Mon, Tue, etc) 
- Time 🕒 (0900, 1800, etc)
- Weather 🌧️ (unfavourable weather conditions may deter gymgoers)
- Public holiday 🎉 (Christmas, Hari Raya, etc)
- School holiday 🏖️ (Poly hols period, Pri Sch hols period, etc)

Edit: PythonAnywhere does not allow access to Activesg's gym capacity website unless you have a paid account, so this project will be put on hold for now

Edit 2: After some research, we will use google cloud run instead of PythonAnywhere. Despite paying for PythonAnywhere, its servers are not based in Singapore, so scraping requests are blocked anyway. With google cloud run, we can scrape locally from Singapore region.

### Announcement: 
Unfortunately, the [ActiveSG gym capacity website](https://crowdcapacity.net/) doesnt allow scraping from not only Google CLoud servers, but also PythonAnywhere servers. 

This makes mass scraping of the site's information unfeasible, hence i can no longer continue this project unless i manually activate my code on my laptop every half an hour for a year. Mission failed, sorry...

Its still possible to scrape through a proxy, but that would probably be illegal and I'm not trying to get arrested. This website aside, the code works fine for any website that does not block the cloud servers, so feel free to use it.
