# Project-activetrack
This project will track the capacity of Yishun Activesg gym over a few days to see which day and time is it least packed. This will allow us to see when is the best time to go there for a workout.

Edit: PythonAnywhere does not allow access to Activesg's gym capacity website unless you have a paid account, so this project will be put on hold for now

Edit: After some research, we will use google cloud run instead of PythonAnywhere. Despite paying for PythonAnywhere, its servers are not based in Singapore, so scraping requests are blocked anyway. With google cloud run, we can scrape locally from Singapore region.
