# Project-activetrack
This project will track the capacity of Yishun Activesg gym over a few days to see which day and time is it least packed. This will allow us to see when is the best time to go there for a workout.
Edit: PythonAnywhere does not allow access to Activesg's gym capacity website unless you have a paid account, so this project will be put on hold for now
